## Main Goal:
    in this project, i create an application of **System Multi Agent** using the concept of **Ontology**.
 
    - **Ontology** it's a descriptor of communicaton between agents.
    - **Ontology** serves to exchange objects 'instances' as a messages between agents.

#### Reminder : 
    - To exchange messages between agents, we need to specify the **Codec** 
    - **Codec** : used in ontology as a language that will converts objects into many formats such as
                        - XMLCodec ( into XML format )
                        - SDCodec ( into String format )
                        - RDFCodec ( into RDF format )
